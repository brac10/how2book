## Listing Your Installed Roles

You can use the ansible-galaxy list command to list all the roles and role versions you have installed.

- ansible-galaxy list

## Installing Multiple Roles From a File

Multiple roles can be installed by listing them in a requirements.yml file. The format of the file is YAML, and the file extension must be either .yml or .yaml.

Use the following command to install roles included in requirements.yml:

- \$ ansible-galaxy install -r requirements.yml

## Dependencies

Roles can be dependent on roles, and when a role is installed, any dependencies are automatically installed as well.

Dependencies are listed in a roleâ€™s meta/main.yml file, using the top-level dependencies keyword. The following shows an example meta/main.yml file with dependent roles:
