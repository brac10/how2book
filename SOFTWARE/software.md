# Software Installation

## Installing Visual Code

- 1. wget https://packagecloud.io/headmelted/codebuilds/gpgkey -O - | sudo apt-key add -

- 2. curl -L https://code.headmelted.com/installers/apt.sh | sudo bash

If version 1.32 is installed, you'll have to us the previous version. (29)

- 3. sudo apt-get install code-oss=1.29.0-1539702286 This will overlay the bad version. (v32)

### Put the code on hold

- 4. sudo apt-mark hold code-oss
     (Run this command to tell the Raspberry PI not to upgrade code-oss when other software is being upgraded as well)

### Installation of Ansible on Control Machine / Servers

## Hardware Overview:

- Control Machine: MAC
- Real Servers: (2) Ubuntu 19.01
- (9 / Raspberry Pi 3b/4B: Debian
  Linux (Buster) ## Installation:

### Step 1: Configure SSH Access on Control

Machine: You can configure key based ssh for the remote Linux Ansible hosts. So password will not be required for SSH. Ansible also allows you to use a password for ssh, but key-based ssh is more secure.

- \$ssh-keygen (you will be prompted with key-name / pass-phrase)
- key: id_rsa.pub - passphrase: leave blank ###

### Step 2: Copy the public key to all of your remote devices needing connectivity

- \$ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub pi@xxx.xxx.xxx.xxxx

### Step 3: Install Ansible on Ubuntu Servers 19.0X

Ansible provides its official PPA for the
installation on Ubuntu systems. Run the following command to configure AnsiblePPA to your Ubuntu 18.04 system.

- \$sudo apt-add-repository ppa:ansible/ansible

### Step 4: After adding the Ansible repository execute below commands to install.

- \$sudo apt update - \$sudo apt install ansible

### Step 5: Install Ansible on Raspberry Pi

- \$ sudo apt update
- \$ sudo pip install ansible

(using Python PIP) can also use Home-brew.
